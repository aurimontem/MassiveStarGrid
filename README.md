# MassiveStarGrid
A (to be public) grid of RSG progenitor models calculated with MESA (revision 10398). 

There's 2 grids: 1 rotating 1 non-rotating, currently 3 types of files: at core-collapse, and at end core infall with the core excised already. Models range from typically ~11-25Msun in increments of 0.5 up to 15 and  1 up to 25, with a handful of 10Msun progenitors surviving this setup as well.

The label is initial mass (10-25), metallicity (all 0.02 in this set), alpha MLT (2, 3, 4), dutch_scaling_factor "eta" (0.1 - 1.0), fraction of initial critical rotation "vvc" (0.0, 0.2,0.3), and exponential overshooting f (0.0,0.001,0.018)

e.g. 25.0M_z0.02_alpha_4.0_eta_0.9_vvc_0.2_f0.01_at_cc.mod
